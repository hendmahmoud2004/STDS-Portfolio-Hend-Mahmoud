# Reflection: GreenStream Energy ETL Task

## What I Learned
- How to design a **serverless ETL pipeline** conceptually.
- Importance of **data cleaning, validation, and standardization**.
- How to handle errors, retries, and archiving for analytics purposes.

## Challenges
- Translating **real-world data issues** into clear business rules.
- Designing a pipeline **without relying on cloud-specific implementations**.

## Improvements from Previous Tasks
- Better structuring of **workflow diagrams and lifecycle explanations**.
- Clearer articulation of **transformation logic and error handling**.
- Stronger emphasis on **data science thinking vs technical cloud setup**.
