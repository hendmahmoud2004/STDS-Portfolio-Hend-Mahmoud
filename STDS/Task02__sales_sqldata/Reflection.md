## 📝 Student Reflection

### 💡 What I Learned
* **Advanced Data Cleaning:** Mastered the process of profiling and cleaning relational tables using T-SQL commands like `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`, `SELECT INTO`, and `UPDATE`.
* **Analytical Modeling:** Learned how to design an analytics-ready model by joining 9+ tables (Header, Detail, Customer, Address, Product) into a **single wide fact table** (`Merged_SalesData`).
* **End-to-End Workflow:** Bridged the gap between SQL Server and Excel by exporting results and building dynamic **Pivot Tables** and a professional **Dashboard**.

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
* **Data Integrity & Joins:** Ensuring consistent keys across complex relationships (e.g., mapping Shipping vs. Billing addresses correctly).
* **Data Quality Management:** Managing nulls and duplicates across multiple staging tables before the final merge.
* **Excel Optimization:** Keeping a multi-sheet Excel workbook with numerous pivots organized and user-friendly.

### 🚀 Improvements from Previous Tasks
* **Structured Framework:** Developed a repeatable SQL cleaning framework (Profile → Clean → Validate → Enrich → Merge).
* **Technical Proficiency:** Increased confidence in writing **JOIN-heavy queries** and performing **Date Engineering** (Day/Month/Year extraction) for time-series analytics.
* **Insight Visualization:** Improved my ability to surface key business metrics such as **Net Sales**, **Avg Order Value (AOV)**, and **Top-performing Categories/Cities**.
