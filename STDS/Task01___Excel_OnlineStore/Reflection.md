# Reflection

## What I learned
- I learned how to clean and prepare a large dataset for analysis in Excel.  
- I understood how to build PivotTables for summarizing sales, profit, and customer information.  
- I learned how to design a basic yet effective dashboard using PivotCharts and slicers.  
- I improved my ability to identify the most relevant columns in a dataset with hundreds of unnecessary fields.

## What was challenging
- The dataset contained hundreds of extra blank or irrelevant columns, which made it difficult to identify useful fields.
- Cleaning date columns and ensuring consistent formatting required attention to detail.
- Selecting the right visualizations for the dashboard took time because of the dataset’s size and variety.

## What I improved from previous tasks
- I improved my data cleaning workflow and became faster at removing irrelevant fields.
- I developed better skills in structuring PivotTables for clearer analysis.
- I created a more polished dashboard compared to previous tasks, focusing on clarity and usability.
